// Todo List

// * Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
// * Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
// * Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017

// For each item render a description and a deadline date.
// Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours.
// You have to use more than two components.
// Think about which props the components should take.
