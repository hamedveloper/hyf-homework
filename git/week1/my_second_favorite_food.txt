HOW TO MAKE POTATO SOUP:
To make this potato soup recipe, simply:

Cook the bacon.  Dice and then sauté it in a large stockpot until it’s nice and crispy.  Then transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels, and reserve a few tablespoons of leftover grease in the stockpot (discarding the rest.)
Sauté the veggies. Sauté the onion and garlic in the bacon grease until softened.  Then stir in some flour, to create your roux.
Add broth and potatoes.  Then add the stock, milk and potatoes.  Cook until the potatoes until softened, being sure to stir the soup regularly so that the bottom does not burn.
Add remaining ingredients.  Then stir in the cheese, Greek yogurt (or sour cream), and crispy bacon bits.  Taste and season the soup with salt and pepper.
Serve warm.  Then serve it up, loaded up with all of your favorite toppings!
