                    <h2>Practicale Web developement</h2>
                    <p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth
                        of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
                        services to customers.[1]</p>

                    <p>There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux,
                        Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to
                        a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of
                        easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and
                        Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
                        languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented
                        quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face
                        training.</p>

                    <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and
                        interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services
                        which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has
                        allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can
                        be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs.
                        These web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, instead of
                        being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>

                    <h2>Web Developement As An Industry</h2>
                    <p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development include
                        e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase
                        goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have
                        transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.</p>
